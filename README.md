# Face-Identification-using-Deep-learning-MTCNN-Algorithm-
This project is face identification project the algorithm which i have used is MTCNN Algorithm where it gives more accuracy.


There are two different codes :
1)detectFacesInImage
       This peace of code will identify the faces in image where the input is image.jpeg
       
2)Pi_cam_face_det:
       This can be used with picam raspberrypi devise where it uses live camera and take photoes and detect face.
